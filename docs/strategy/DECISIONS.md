# Consequential decisions

## D-001 — Permanent project identity

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Use `cypshift` for the repository, Python package, and CLI.
- Evidence: A permanent name avoids migration churn and keeps installation,
  documentation, and publication references stable.
- Alternatives: A provisional or descriptive long-form package name.
- Reversal condition: A verified package-index or legal naming conflict.

## D-002 — Pre-launch Phase 0 fixture

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: CI and examples use a tiny synthetic redistributable fixture before
  the challenge launch.
- Evidence: It enables a complete implementation without encoding unreleased
  schema or distributing restricted data.
- Alternatives: Wait until launch; develop directly against public CYP data.
- Reversal condition: None for CI. Public data may later supplement development
  after a license and provenance review.

## D-003 — Launch-day freeze boundary

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Freeze the official schema, data snapshot, metric, submission
  contract, rules, and challenge-faithful splits on or after 2026-08-17.
- Evidence: The official announcement explicitly defers detailed information to
  launch day.
- Alternatives: Hard-code announcement-derived assumptions.
- Reversal condition: OpenADMET publishes an earlier resource explicitly marked
  final and authoritative.

## D-004 — Private, signed, milestone-based development

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Develop in a private personal repository using signed commits,
  short-lived branches, focused pull requests, and frequent passing milestone
  pushes.
- Evidence: This provides a clean timecourse without exposing provisional work
  or restricted data.
- Alternatives: Public-from-start development; direct pushes to `main`.
- Reversal condition: Make the repository public after Phase 0, data licensing,
  and disclosure checks pass.
- Implementation note: GitHub returned a plan restriction when branch
  protection was requested for the private personal repository. Until the
  repository becomes public or the account plan changes, every post-bootstrap
  change must still use a branch and pull request by procedure; force-pushes and
  unreviewed direct `main` updates remain prohibited by project policy.
- Merge procedure: GitHub's hosted rebase merge was tested on PR 1 and rewrote
  the SSH-signed branch commit as unsigned. Future pull requests are integrated
  only after review by fast-forwarding the signed branch commit locally and
  pushing that exact commit to `main`; the remote topic branch is then deleted.

## D-005 — Authorship and tooling provenance

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Git authorship is `zchboswell`; never identify Codex, OpenAI, an AI
  system, or an automated tool as an author or co-author. Record required model
  and tool provenance separately from authorship.
- Evidence: Authorship and reproducibility metadata serve different purposes.
- Alternatives: Automated co-author trailers.
- Reversal condition: None without an explicit owner decision.

## D-006 — Defer license selection

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: superseded by D-010
- Decision: Do not select the final permissive license until Phase 0 production
  dependencies and redistributed assets are known.
- Evidence: License compatibility must be checked against actual retained
  dependencies and data.
- Alternatives: Add a license before the dependency audit.
- Reversal condition: The dependency and asset set is frozen and compatible.

## D-007 — Orchestration continuity through Phase 0

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Keep the current orchestrator through Phase 0 and restore context
  from the canonical knowledge base after every compression or handoff. Add no
  architecture beyond what the running vertical slice requires.
- Evidence: The current orchestrator owns the intent and decision history;
  replacement before implementation would add context loss and duplicate
  planning.
- Alternatives: Hand implementation immediately to a fresh orchestrator.
- Reversal condition: Scope expansion, simplicity violations, or inability to
  leave a clean reproducible state. After Phase 0, use a fresh agent as an
  independent reviewer before considering orchestration handoff.

## D-008 — Minimal Phase 0 Python toolchain

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Develop with Python 3.12 while supporting Python 3.11 and newer;
  use `uv` and `uv_build`; retain RDKit as the sole runtime dependency; keep
  pytest, Ruff, and mypy development-only. Use the standard library for the
  CLI, CSV/JSON I/O, schemas, hashing, statistics, and HTML generation.
- Evidence: The host already provides Python 3.11/3.12 and `uv`. RDKit 2026.03.4
  provides Python 3.11-3.14 wheels across major platforms under BSD-3-Clause.
  The vertical slice requires chemistry parsing and standardization but does
  not require pandas, Pydantic, Click, Typer, or a configuration framework.
- Alternatives: system Python 3.9; pandas/Pydantic/Typer stack; a larger
  cheminformatics framework; Conda-only installation.
- Reversal condition: A launch-day requirement or measured user need that the
  standard library plus RDKit cannot meet cleanly.
- Sources:
  - https://pypi.org/project/rdkit/
  - https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html
  - https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/
  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use
- CI implementation note: Pin uv 0.12.3 and the full commits for checkout
  v7.0.1 and setup-uv v9.0.0. Test the declared minimum Python 3.11 and
  current Python 3.14 on Linux. The build-backend range follows uv's 0.12
  migration guidance while retaining an upper compatibility bound.

## D-009 — Phase 0 source-revision binding

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Release the completed Phase 0 state as package version `0.1.0` and
  bind its manifests to the signed Git tag `v0.1.0`.
- Evidence: Package version `0.0.1` covered multiple materially different
  commits and could not uniquely select reproducible source. A signed tag is
  available in both source control and installed-wheel metadata without adding
  a runtime dependency or requiring a Git checkout at prediction time.
- Alternatives: Read the local Git commit dynamically; add build-backend
  version plugins; retain package version alone without a source mapping.
- Reversal condition: Begin post-Phase-0 development, which must advance the
  development version before producing new run manifests.

## D-010 — Permissive code and fixture licenses

- Date: 2026-08-09
- Status: accepted
- Decision: License `cypshift` code under BSD-3-Clause. Keep the independently
  hand-authored synthetic fixture under its existing CC0-1.0 dedication.
- Evidence: Phase 0 retains RDKit as its only runtime dependency; RDKit is
  BSD-3-Clause. The development tools use compatible permissive licenses and
  are not runtime dependencies. The fixture contains invented data intended
  for unrestricted redistribution in CI and examples.
- Alternatives: MIT for code; Apache-2.0 for code; keep the repository
  unlicensed until public release.
- Reversal condition: A dependency, asset, employer, journal, or legal review
  identifies an incompatibility before public release.
